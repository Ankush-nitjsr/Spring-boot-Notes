# 8 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR SPRING BOOT SKILLS

## [1. Good Understanding of Starter POM(Project Object Model)](url)

  Starter POMs removes the pain of looking for and configuring common dependencies in your project.

  The spring-boot-starter-data-jpa is a starter for using Spring Data JPA. It includes the following compiled dependencies:

>1.  **spring-boot-starter-jdbc:** This starter includes the necessary libraries for JDBC.
>2.  **hibernate-core:** This is the main library for Hibernate, which is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution.
>3.  **spring-data-jpa:** This library provides the core Spring Data JPA functionality.
>4.  **spring-boot-starter-aop:** This library enables Aspect-Oriented Programming in Spring Boot which addresses cross-cutting concerns for cleaner, modular code.
>5.  **spring-aspects:** This library is typically used when you need the advanced features provided by AspectJ, such as weaving into third-party libraries.
